Is the WTC points system really fair? 🏏

Taking nothing away from South Africa — they’ve played some fantastic Test cricket in this cycle — but it raises a serious question: Is it truly a fair comparison when some teams play nearly double the number of matches than others in a WTC cycle?

India, Australia, and England play far more Tests compared to South Africa or New Zealand. More matches mean more opportunities, but also more risks. Meanwhile, teams playing fewer matches can be more selective and still qualify with a higher win percentage.

A similar situation happened in the WTC 2021 final, where India had played more matches, won overseas series in Australia, and still lost out to New Zealand — a team that hadn't toured as much, but qualified due to a better win percentage.

And then comes the venue: why are the WTC finals always hosted in England, a venue with conditions completely alien to Asian teams? Swing, seam, and overcast conditions don't represent global Test cricket fairly — especially for teams from the subcontinent who dominate in spin-friendly conditions.

Shouldn’t the ICC look into:

A more balanced number of matches per team in the cycle?

A neutral final venue that doesn't heavily favor one style of cricket?

A fairer format, maybe a best-of-3 final or home-away leg?

The WTC is a brilliant concept, but for it to truly crown the best Test team in the world, the system must be just as fair as the cricket it celebrates.
